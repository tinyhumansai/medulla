# Workflows

A Medulla task is one instruction handed to one harness. A **workflow** is a
saved, multi-step plan: a directed acyclic graph whose `agent` steps each run as
a real coding-harness session — Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode — in the order
and with the parallelism the graph declares.

The engine is [`tinyflows`](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/tinyflows), vendored
under `vendor/tinyflows` (see [vendoring.md](vendoring.md)). Medulla supplies the
capabilities it runs against, which is where the difference from every other host
embedding that engine lives: **an `agent` node here is a dispatched task, not a
model call.**

## Where workflows live

JSON documents, one graph per file, in two layered directories — lowest
precedence first:

```
<medulla home>/workflows/*.json     # yours, on this machine
<cwd>/.medulla/workflows/*.json     # this repository's, checked in
```

Same layering as `.medulla/agents`, so a workflow committed to a repository
shadows a personal one of the same id. A malformed document costs only itself:
the rest of the catalogue still loads and the failure is reported.

Run records live under `<medulla home>/state/workflows/runs/`, and the engine's
checkpoints — what lets a paused run survive a restart — under
`state/workflows/checkpoints/`.

## Writing one

The smallest useful workflow is a trigger and a step:

```json
{
  "name": "Triage",
  "description": "look at the repo, then summarise",
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "t", "kind": "trigger", "name": "start",
      "config": { "trigger_kind": "manual" } },
    { "id": "look", "kind": "agent", "name": "Inspect the repo",
      "config": { "prompt": "list the top-level files" } },
    { "id": "sum", "kind": "transform", "name": "Summarise",
      "config": { "set": { "report": "=.item.text" } } }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "from_node": "t", "to_node": "look" },
    { "from_node": "look", "to_node": "sum" }
  ]
}
```

Exactly one node must be a `trigger`. `medulla workflow catalog` prints the
contract for all twelve node kinds, with this host's notes layered on — read it
before writing a graph rather than guessing at field names.

Things worth knowing about `agent` nodes here:

- `config.prompt` is the instruction (`instruction` is accepted as an alias).
- `config.agent_ref` names the **worker** to dispatch to. Omit it to use
  `workflows.defaultWorker`; with neither, the run fails and says so.
- The harness reply is `=item.text`. If the harness replied with JSON it is
  parsed too, so `=item.json.<field>` works without an `output_parser`.
- `config.requires_approval: true` parks the run until someone approves it.

Any config string beginning `=` is a jq expression evaluated against
`{ item, items, run, nodes }`.

## Running one

```sh
medulla workflow list                 # what is installed
medulla workflow dry-run triage       # simulate: no harness, no network
medulla workflow run triage           # for real, on this machine's CLIs
medulla workflow list-runs triage     # history
medulla workflow resume <run-id> --approve review
medulla workflow cancel <run-id>   # only reaches runs in this process — see below
```

`cancel` is process-local. A run started by `medulla workflow run` in one shell
cannot be cancelled from another, because there is no control channel between two
CLI invocations; the command says so rather than reporting a bare failure. The
paths that can always cancel are the ones that own the running process: the TUI
cancels the run it started, and an orchestrator's abort frame reaches the daemon
executing it.

`dry-run` is the one to reach for while authoring. Validation catches a malformed
graph; a dry run catches a *well-formed* graph that is wired wrong — every
expression is resolved and every declared output shape satisfied, against
capability stand-ins, with nothing dispatched.

Every verb prints JSON and reads bulk input from stdin, so the command is usable
by a person and by an agent without either being a special case.

The TUI has the same surface on **Routing → Workflows**: the catalogue, the
selected workflow's recent runs, `Enter` to run, `r` to re-read the store.

## How an agent authors one

Medulla drives Claude Code and Codex over ACP as a *client*, so it cannot hand
them tools directly — it offers them. Every ACP session gets an MCP server
(`medulla workflow mcp`, this same binary) exposing:

| tool | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `workflow_list` / `workflow_get` | read the catalogue |
| `workflow_catalog` | the node-kind contracts, with host notes |
| `workflow_create` | install from a whole document |
| `workflow_apply_ops` / `workflow_preview_ops` | edit by graph patch |
| `workflow_validate` | check a saved or unsaved graph |
| `workflow_dry_run` | simulate without dispatching |
| `workflow_runs` | run history |

`workflow_apply_ops` is the one that matters for editing. Rewriting a whole
document loses whatever the model misremembered; a patch is checked op by op, and
a batch that fails anywhere leaves the workflow untouched. One sharp edge:
`rename_node` rewires edges but does **not** rewrite `=nodes.<id>` expressions
inside other nodes' configs.

## How the orchestrator runs one

Two additions to the existing task protocol, both optional and backward
compatible:

- A worker's capability probe now advertises `workflows` — the ids it has
  installed, with names, descriptions, and step counts.
- A task frame may carry a `workflow` field. Naming one makes the worker run that
  saved graph instead of handing the frame's `text` to a harness; the text
  becomes the trigger payload. The ack, the reply, the correlation, and the
  work-snapshot attachment are all the ordinary ones, so an orchestrator that
  knows nothing about workflows still sees a task it dispatched and a task that
  answered.

Aborting the task cancels the run: the frame's task id is the run id, and every
node dispatched by that run carries it as its `abort_id`.

## Progress

A run reports itself in the *existing* `harness_work` vocabulary — a
`plan_update` naming every node, `todo_update` as steps settle, `subagent_start`
per agent node, and a `run_result`. So a workflow renders through the same pane
that shows a harness's own todo list, with no rendering code of its own.

## Configuration

The `workflows` section. Every capability defaults to **off**: a workflow arrives
as a file, possibly written by an agent, and the difference between a plan and an
exploit is whether it can reach the network, run code, or call a third-party
tool.

```toml
[workflows]
enabled = true
defaultWorker = ""        # where agent nodes with no agentRef go
defaultProvider = ""      # claude | codex | opencode
defaultModel = ""
allowCode = false         # code nodes: no sandbox here, so off by default
toolAllowlist = []        # beyond the built-in medulla:* tools
httpAllowlist = []        # a bare domain also permits its subdomains
runTimeoutSecs = 600
```

Note this is `workflows`, plural. The older `workflow` key is unrelated — despite
the name it is only a list of workspace roots.

Two guards are not configurable:

- **Loopback and private addresses** are refused for `http_request` whatever the
  allowlist says — checked both by literal *and* against every address the host
  resolves to, so an allowlisted name answering `127.0.0.1` is caught. Redirects
  are not followed, since only the first URL is ever checked. A name that cannot
  be resolved is refused rather than attempted.
- **`code` nodes have no sandbox** on this host, so enabling them grants a
  workflow author the daemon's own privileges. The refusal message says as much.

Workflow ids and run ids both become filenames and are validated as single path
components before use: a document's `id` overrides the caller's, and a run id can
arrive on a task frame from a peer, so neither is trusted to stay inside its
directory.

Credentials never appear in a graph: a node names one with
`connection_ref: "http_cred:<name>"`, and the header is injected after any
summary of the call has been taken, so a secret cannot reach a log or an approval
prompt.

## Building it

The feature is behind a default-on `workflows` cargo feature in both crates, so a
slim build can drop the engine and its jq stack:

```sh
cargo build --no-default-features   # no workflows
```
